How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    difficult at first, but once I became more familiar with the formatting it was quite useful

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You won't need to go all the way back.  Having checkpoints will make narrowing down search fields easier for anything you may be looking for.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros- more control over the content.  Cons- Must be more aware, could easily forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows multiple files to save at once to take a complete snapshot of your work at once.  If some files didn't change that's okay, but if multiple files have changed you can track them all at once

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Don't know yet 100%.  Not sure what those commands do completely.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Easily know where a safe reload/backup point is.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    whatever you tell me to.
